    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Ferrari was founded in 1939 by Enzo Ferrari, originally as Auto Avio Costruzioni. The first car to bear the Ferrari name was the 125 S, which debuted in 1947. From its earliest days, Ferrari was built on a passion for racing and performance. The company quickly rose to prominence in motorsports, particularly in Formula One, where it remains the most successful team in history.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Ferrari is headquartered in Maranello, Italy, and has maintained its commitment to hand-built craftsmanship and innovation. The brand’s signature red color, Rosso Corsa, is a nod to Italy’s national racing color. Ferrari’s road cars are often inspired by its racing technology, blending performance with elegance.</p>

    <h2>Founder & Ownership</h2>
    <p>Enzo Ferrari, a former Alfa Romeo racing driver, founded the company with a vision to build the world’s fastest and most beautiful cars. He remained deeply involved in the company until his death in 1988. Today, Ferrari is a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with Exor N.V. (the Agnelli family holding company) as its largest shareholder.</p>

    <h2>Racing Milestones</h2>

    <h3>First Race – May 11, 1947</h3>
    <p>Ferrari’s first official race was at the Piacenza Circuit in Italy. The 125 S, driven by Franco Cortese, showed promise but retired due to a fuel pump issue.</p>
